----------

Computational statistics in the style of SCEADAN,
except without all those awful #ifdefs I added :/

(i.e., it *should* be bigger, better, faster #else
possibly more or less readable #endif)
----------

RN the main focus is interleaving loop bodies.
- Suppose our input vector is length N
- and we are computing M statistics,
- such as mean, median and mode (i.e., M=3)
- Normally, you would do:
  - mean   (vector)
  - median (vector)
  - mode   (vector)
- But now, you can do (something like):
  - for e in vector:
    - update mean
    - update median
    - update mode
- N.B., this doesn't decrease the asymptotic complexity,
but what it does allow for is larger loop bodies for the compiler to unroll.
(thanks, Dr. Maynard, for teaching Computer Architecture and all those other great classes)

Ideally, we'll add multi-threaded single-pass algorithms,
so computations can be done in sublinear time without loss of data.

And then we'll add random sampling for sub-sublinear time,
because no large software system is complete without loss of data.

TODO
- variable-length n-grams
- mean/median files (i.e., compute "average" files of different types)
- conditional entropy
- statistics on the derivative (i.e., delta consecutive byte values)
- statistics on histogram
- statistics on histogram of the histogram ?
- statistics on derivative of the histogram ?
- statistics on histogram of the derivative ?
